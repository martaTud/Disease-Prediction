 Disease-Prediction

## Overview
Disease Prediction is a machine learning-based system that analyzes patient symptoms and medical history to predict the likelihood of various diseases. The goal of this project is to provide an assistive tool for early diagnosis, improving patient outcomes and aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making.

## Features
- Predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms
- Utilizes machine learning models trained on medical datasets
- Provides probabilistic outputs with confidence scores
- Interactive web-based interface for easy input and results visualization
- Scalable and extendable with additional datasets and models

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Pip
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/disease-prediction.git
   cd disease-prediction
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the application:
   ```sh
   python app.py
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the application and enter symptoms via the web interface or CLI.
2. The model will analyze the input and predict possible diseases with probabilities.
3. Review the output and, if necessary, seek medical advice.

## Model Training
To train the model on a new dataset:
```sh
python train_model.py --data dataset.csv
```
Ensure that your dataset follows the expected format:
```
| Symptom 1 | Symptom 2 | Symptom 3 | ... | Disease |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----|---------|
```

## Technologies Used
- Python (Flask, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend if applicable)
- Jupyter Notebook (for model training and evaluation)

## Dataset
This project uses open-source medical datasets. If you use proprietary datasets, ensure compliance with data privacy laws.
